# lets.hang.together
**"lets.hang.together"** is a classic Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word

This project represents my independent work in creating a hangman word-guessing game, utilizing various technologies for development.
The project was built using **Java Sockets**, **Servlets**, **JSP**, **RMI**, with **JPA** and **JDBC** for database access. To enable real-time communication among players on the frontend, the project integrated the **socket.io** library. The main goal of this project was to leverage a diverse range of technologies for the development of the game.
